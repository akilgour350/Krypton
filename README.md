# Krypton

## What is Krypton?
Krypton is a library of methods that can be used for basic file handling, as well as for encoding and decoding strings.

## What files can Krypton handle?
Krypton can handle every form of text file, such as TXT or CSV.

## What encoding does Krypton offer?
Krypton offers encoding and decoding utilising the following formats available through C#'s Encoding class:
- ASCII
- Latin1
- Unicode
- UTF-8
- UTF-32

Please note that these are forms of encoding, not encryption! They are not fully secure, and are only meant to make data un-readable!
